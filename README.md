# VR-Emergency-Training
a proof of concept project VR training for fires, earthquakes, and plane crashes, teaches users what to do in those cases by physically hiding under tables, evacuate, and taking the brace position made in Unity3d for Oculus devices.

has an offline demo demo mode, and a login and signup feature to access an online mode where data from training is recorded through a backend REST API and and can bbe viewed from a front end web app.

[Back end](https://github.com/shoshanimayan/EmergencyTrainingBackend)
[Front end](https://github.com/shoshanimayan/emergencyTrainingWebFrontEnd)

neither the front end nor backend are currently hosted online, because of both cost and data privacy concerns, and therefore need to be run locally , see their respective repos for instructions on how to see that up.

the project was originally built in 2020 as both a VR learning project and as a proof of concept for a VR enterprise usecase, I came back to it in 2021 to both cleanup the code a bit and add the online front and back end features.
